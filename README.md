# 16-Bit MicroProcessor

Hello to all reading this! This was a project that I completed after my very first introduction to computer architecture course. This is a 16 bit microprocessor that I designed and implemented in digital logic. It has 22 instructions. For this project, I have a few folders listed:



      Digital Logic: All of my digital logic to design the CPU
      
      Architecture: A datapath and overview of the architecture of my processor
      
      Instruction Set: An explanation of all of the instructions I implemented, as well as the way each instruction is formatted in machine code (in the file cpudef.asm)
      
      Automation: Unit tests that I automated to test out my CPU
            
      Sample Assembly Code: A few assembly code files to try some things out on my CPU

This project was more of a passion/hobby project and a great learning experience for me. If you have any questions, please reach out (brindha2@illinois.edu)! I love hearing other people's thoughts and ways to make my work easier for others to understand. 


Note, if you would like to view the digital logic design, you must download the logic simulation app Digital, otherwise it just looks like a bunch of code. You can get the software here: https://github.com/hneemann/Digital/releases
