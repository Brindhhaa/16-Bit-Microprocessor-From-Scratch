# 16-Bit MicroProcessor

Hello to all reading this! This was a project that I completed after my very first introduction to computer architecture course. This is a 16 bit microprocessor with a retro style GPU and 32 instructions. For this project, I have a few folders listed:



      Digital Logic: All of my digital logic to design the CPU
      
      Architecture: A datapath and overview of the architecture of my processor
      
      Instruction Set: An explanation of all of the instructions I implemented
      
      Automation: Unit tests that I automated to test out my CPU
      
      Assembler: The assemble to create my instructions
      
      Sample Assembly Code: A few assembly code files to try some things out on my CPU

  




This project was more of a passion/hobby project and a great learning experience for me. If you have any questions, please reach out! I love hearing other people's thoughts and ways to make my work easier for others to understand.
